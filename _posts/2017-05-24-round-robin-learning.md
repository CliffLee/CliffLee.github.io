Lately I've been trying my hand at learning a ton of new frameworks, languages, and technologies. Admittedly, some of this is kind of mandated by upcoming work, but the driving force behind learning all of this new stuff is still largely self-motivated! Motivated or not though, I'm starting to feel like my round robin approach to learning all this new stuff isn't too productive.

The following is a list of things I'm trying to learn (in a descending order of priority):
* Learning GoLang
* Understanding microservice architecture
* Learning Caddy
* Learning React-Native
* Reviewing Node.js because I'm starting to feel the rustiness
* Learning Vue.js
* Learning basic concepts for database administration

I feel as though this isn't *too* bad now, but that's probably because I have plenty of time right now to consistently study everything daily. When I start working though, I'm probably going to have to figure out a different studying policy so I don't completely forget everything after maybe a day or two of not touching a specific subject.

Something I need to get a move on (which will definitely help me iron out some of these learning challenges) is finding more projects to actually do with all this new tech. Personally, I prefer project-based learning, but I always start off with book/documentation cramming to have a good foundation to work with. I feel like I've been cramming docs for a while now for all of these things, so hopefully I can get started working on some fun little projects here or there. Hopefully after some time, I could start taking some tips from this [dev.to][dev.to-article] article and contribute to open source projects for practice. Peep the Github contributions in the next few days!



Side Notes:
* Did some updates to the site!
	* Added some additional styling (that admittedly I noticed while writing this post)
	* Added styling to make code blocks/snippets look like a terminal/editor

```C++
public int main() {
	std::cout << "Hello World!" << std::endl;
}
```
