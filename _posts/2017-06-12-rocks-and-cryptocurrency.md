### Absence

Howdy folks, I'm still alive! I haven't been able (read remembered) to write a post in a while. That's pretty bad since I literally told myself I'd use these posts to hold myself to my hack-y goals, but it's sort of alright because I've kind of kept up with them without the posting! A lot has happened in the last ~3 weeks, so let me catch you up to speed.

### Utah

I gotta be honest, when I was on the flight to Provo, Utah, I feeling pretty sketched out. I was worried that I'd be met with frequent conversion attempts or, possibly even worse, completely ignored and forced to live as a shutin for three straight months. The latter definitely affected my behavior the first two days, but after pushing myself to open up a bit, I ended meeting a lot of really nice people. These last two weeks have definitely helped me get more used to coming out of my shell and I'm really relieved I decided to reach out rather than lock myself up. I've made a lot of new friends, all of whom have some really interesting backgrounds. Unfortunately, work and other personal obligations keep me sort of busy on the weekdays. However, on the weekends, I usually go and hang out with the other interns. Just this past weekend, a group of us went out to Southern Utah on a 2 day camping/hiking trip through Kanarraville Falls, Zion National Park, and Bryce Canyon. I'm really glad I went because now I feel much closer to my peers.

### Qualtrics

Speaking of interning, Qualtrics has been keeping me pretty busy. There's rarely a dull moment there because if I'm not actively working on a sprint task, I'm either attending a design meeting, listening in on intern lecture series, participating in a book club meeting, or hanging out with peers/teammates. Every other day I'm learning either a new piece of industry relevant software, architecture/design pattern, or any other exciting tidbit of modern software engineering.

One qualm I have with working life is that a lot of the time I used to have for doing my own little side projects has been cut down dramatically. It's even worse now because Qualtrics is providing me with a lot more knowledge in terms of turning hacky, side project-y ideas into realities. So now, when I have the idea, I really want to see how I can follow a company-esque approach to making it a reality.

I think a lot of this stems from the fact that I get to be really involved in the design aspect of Qualtrics projects. I get to be a part of the whiteboarding and more often than not, I'm the one driving those whiteboard sessions. We can start at a super low level, looking at a core algorithm we'd like to design, and then blow it up to scale, looking at how everything would work together in a large system. I'm not sure if this is what some of my interviewers meant when they said that Qualtrics has a very start-up culture, but I can certainly see the pros to this.

### In Other News

Recently, I've been drawing up some plans I have for some clubs I'm in as well as for some projects that I can hopefully work on outside of work. I've also started getting into cryptocurrency speculation with some coworkers at Qualtrics and with any luck, I might try to build a mining machine some time in the future!
