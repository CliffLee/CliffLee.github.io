After many different revisions of my personal website (5 and counting), I've finally landed on a version that I'm pretty happy about releasing! Behold, CliffLee.github.io!

This website is built with vanilla html and javascript, with a little sprinkle of Sass for more organized styling. Originally, this website was built purely out of these tools, but I wanted to have some sort of blogging aspect to this website. And thus, Jekyll was introduced into the mix! For those who aren't familiar, [Jekyll][jekyll-docs] is a great static site generator with options to configure static websites for blogging and what not. And! Github pages uses Jekyll! For those who are stuck on finding a static site solution, I'd highly recommend it.

Jekyll configuration was a little funky, as I haven't actually messed around with the blog indexing or pagination before. Let me tell you, that was a pain. But fortunately, plenty of other people on StackOverflow have come across the same pain (It's `gems: [..., jekyll-paginate]`!). From there, it's a ton of configuring that you can read plenty about in the docs.

I expect this website to be going through plenty of revisions (in terms of content and structure), but that's half the fun. Also, while this blog is a medium for me to share my thoughts, I'm also hoping that it'll help incentivize me to be learning regularly. Ideally, I'd like to post pretty regularly, but to do so I'd better have the content to sustain it.

If you've read this far, thanks and I hope you'll find my journey interesting!
